This is our entry for UCRBioHacks. Homeless Helper is a app/kiosk cloud system designed to help the homeless.
Homeless individuals can opt in to the kiosk by adding their social security number or other 9 digit identifier
with which they can be identified. 

The cloud system will allow any user to access their data from any kiosk in the relevant city/state.
Once a user is logged in to their account, they can access a variety of services. They can make an appointment at and get directions to their local health clinic 
if they are feeling sick. They can turn in recycled materials they find for points (with sharper, more dangerous itmes being worth greater points as an incentive). 
Items they turn in can be placed in a sealed bin next to the kiosk. Then they can use those points to purchase healthcare items from the kiosk like sanitary wipes, 
feminine care products, and clean bottled water. This will allow users to maintain their personal healthcare. 
Finally, users will be able to call for emergency services if they feel unsafe. A 911 dispatcher will call emergency services to that location and ask the user for more help. 

There were a few improvements we would like to make. Given more time, we would like the recycle system to use an image scanner to verify what the users turn in for points. Instead we allow users to self report what items they find. Finally, we would have liked to add a speaker option if the user selects emergency services  so they can talk with
the call dispatcher and explain what is wrong in case they are in imminent danger and can't type.
